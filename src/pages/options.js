            This course covers the principles of Options Trading in a comprehensive and unique manner, including a look at both the theoretical and practical aspects.<br/>
            As with all our programmes, flexible learning is essential. That’s why we offer you the opportunity to learn options trading directly on our London Trading Floor, or online. <br/><br/>
            The programme was created and is taught directly by Alberto Pallotta, our Senior Quantitative Trader. A seasoned professional with a verified track record in options trading and a multitude of accolades and qualifications, Alberto brings with him years of experience, expertise, and cutting-edge options trading know-how. He makes it look easy – and by the time you’ve finished going through his course, you’ll be the one making it look easy!<br/><br/>
            Why is this important? Well there is a lot of mis-sold information on the internet from people claiming you can win 90% of your trades using options trading strategies such as trading credit spreads. Of course, this is not necessarily completely incorrect, but what they fail to teach you is that when it finally doesn’t work you will lose all your money.<br/><br/>
            If you are looking for a professional options trading course in London or online, you have come to the right place.<br/>
            We only teach you options trading strategies that we trade ourselves. Our focus is on helping you understand the risks involved as well as the opportunities available using options versus trading the underlying.<br/><br/>
            There are no magic pills or get-rich-quick methods that really work, but there are tools that only very few sophisticated professional investors/traders use, which can give you a big competitive edge over others.<br/><br/> The aim of the course is to provide a thorough education on Options Theory which is an absolute necessity if one wants to excel in Options Trading. The delegate will be able to build their own trading strategies utilising options and will be provided with our tested strategies to use as a starting point.

              Why this course ?
            </IntroTitle>
            <DescriptionContainer style={{fontSize: "16px", color: "#4B586A", marginTop: "10px"}}>
            Most option courses do not teach the theoretical aspects of option pricing and trading. They only teach you how to place orders in accordance to pre-built strategies, without the student understanding why they work.<br/><br/>
            In this course we provide students with a strong foundation of the theoretical elements, as such the student will be able to understand why the strategies they will be using work, how they are built, and most importantly, they will have the capability to develop new strategies. We stress that it is not possible to achieve this without a strong theoretical background; hence it is a core tenant of this course.

        Why Learn Options?
        </IntroTitle>
        <DescriptionContainer  style={{fontSize: "16px", color: "#4B586A", marginTop: "10px"}}>
        Options trading allows you to take control of an asset – like a stock – but for a fraction of the cost without ever having to buy it. Instead of investing all your capital into owning something, you can simply take control of it and benefit from any movement in your direction whilst limiting your risk.<br/><br/>
        Unlike traditional markets such as FX, there are also options trading strategies where you can benefit from other factors such as an increase or decrease in volatility. This makes options trading a much more sophisticated and powerful tool.<br/><br/>
        Trading options without the correct knowledge can also be very dangerous, as there can be a lot of complexity when you don’t understand the mechanics. For example, it is much easier to buy a stock where if it goes up you make money, or when it goes down you lose money.

        <DescriptionContainer  style={{fontSize: "16px", color: "#4B586A", marginTop: "10px"}}>
        Options offer a much more powerful solution where you can make money even if the market doesn’t move. Or even if you are wrong on direction there are some options trading strategies you can use that allow you to profit when you are wrong.
