            baseline fundamentals that you NEED to know before getting into trading the forex
            markets. Foundational Knowledge such as a solid understanding of how the market
            operates, how to perform fundamental analysis, how to understand price action and
            perform technical analysis, and how to predict future price movement by understanding

            Advanced Technical Trading Tactics - Once you’ve formulated a solid understanding of
            the Foundations of Trading, it’s time to craft a profitable trading strategy. You’ll learn
            how to develop a trading strategy of your own, how to manage your money and
            position size appropriately, and how to back-test your strategy based on historical
            data. Most importantly though, this is the area where we dive deep into some of the
            advanced mindset techniques utilised by institutional traders in order to allow their
            trading strategies to operate how they are meant to. Upon completion of this pillar,
            you’ll be ready to take your assessment to receive a funded account available for you

          Our core focus is on understanding price action and the role financial institutions play
in trading. Trading is very much driven by institutions and retail traders are often used
as bait to fulfil their own agendas. Once you understand what’s at play you will have a
light bulb moment.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Within the programme you will come to understand about market structure, how the
market moves in Fibonacci waves, and you will also learn to identify and play the traps
that institutions like to put out.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Indicators, retail theory, fundamental principles will also be taught, but you will learn to
use these in a unique and rule-based approach to trading.

          There is a no one size fits all approach. The goal is to model a successful trader and
then to use the information to create your own approach. We will help you develop
your own trading plan and you will be fully competent in implementing it consistently in
the market.

          <DescriptionContainer style={{fontSize: "14px", color: "#4B586A", marginTop: "10px"}}>
          The best way to learn is by observing and modelling. During your programme you will
be receiving regular videos and screenshots with trade setups (pre-trade) and
educational follow-ups on trades taken. These will be sent to you personally and you
will be able to instantly ask questions if anything is unclear, and you can choose to
take the same trade if you wish.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The goal is not to give you tips and signals for trades. The goal is to give you
inspiration and knowledge so that you can master the techniques and identify your
preferred method of trading.

          By the end of the programme the objective is to be trading or on course to be trading a
six-figure trading account. Once you are funded, we believe in taking a low-risk
approach to trading in order to ensure that you can grow your account steadily and
never risk losing it. With modest risk a target of 5% a month is very much achievable
which for most people would be enough to live on. To earn more you can simply apply
for more funding rather than increasing the risk. This will ensure that you are never
under too much pressure to perform and will allow you to be on the path of making
trading your biggest or main source of income.
