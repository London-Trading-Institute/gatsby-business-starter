                <br/>While our trade ideas, from our wider understanding of and experience from trading the financial markets hold  merit, they do not guarantee success or profit and you should not undertake the act of trading them unless you  are fully aware of risk management and how to place an order with the broker correctly.  Users should understand that past performance is not indicative of future results, and that the value of  investments and income from them may go up as well as down and are not guaranteed.  You may lose the entire amount invested. With some leveraged investments such as spread bets and CFDs, your  losses may potentially be unlimited.
