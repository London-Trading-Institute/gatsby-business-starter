                <br/><BulletT>Request access to your personal data.</BulletT>
                <br/><BulletT>You have the right to access your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and check that we are lawfully processing it.</BulletT>
                <br/><BulletT>To make a request: If you wish to make a request for access to your information, please contact us at London Trading Institute, New Broad Street House, 5 New Broad Street, London EC2M 1NH, United Kingdom or email us info@londontradinginstitute.com</BulletT>
                <br/><BulletT>No fee usually required: You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights), although we have the right to charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</BulletT>

                <br/><BulletT>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</BulletT>
                <br/><BulletT>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month from the date your access request is received. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</BulletT>
                <br/><BulletT>Request correction of your personal data: This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</BulletT>
                <br/><BulletT>Request erasure of your personal data, This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</BulletT>
